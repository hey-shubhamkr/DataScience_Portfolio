# [Project 1 : Audiobook-Casestudy](https://github.com/hey-shubhamkr/Audiobook-Casestudy) 
<b>About - Creating a Machine learning algorithm to predict if a customer will buy again using Tensorflow. <br></b>
This is a data from an Audiobook app. Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once. I have created a machine learning algorithm using Tensorflow based on the available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company with an accuracy of 90.6% 

# [Project 2 : Covid Analysis](https://github.com/hey-shubhamkr/CovidAnalysis/blob/main/Covid%20Cases.ipynb) 
<b>About - Exploratory Data Analysis using Plotly on Covid Data</b><br>
This is a project which focuses on analysing the Infection rate in different countries and checking the effectiveness of Lockdown in the country.Infection Rate is the daily change in confirmed cases which will helps us to understand the pace of spread in any country.\
The chosen dataset updates regularly which keeps our visualization relevant everytime we run it.\
I am using plotly to visualise the data. Github performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.

# [Project 3 : BankCustomer-Segmentation](https://github.com/hey-shubhamkr/BankCustomer-Segmentation-/blob/main/Bank%20Segmentation.ipynb)
<b>About - Leveraging the power of ML to transform marketing departments and perform customer segmentation </b><br>
This project focuses on unsupervised machine learning algorithm to perform customer market segmentation. Market segmentation is crucial for marketers since it enables them to launch targeted ad marketing campaigns that are tailored to customer's specific needs.<br>

Key concpets covered are -
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <br>
- K-means clustering machine learning algorithm<br>
- Elbow method to find optimal number of clusters

# [Project 4 : MNIST-Classification](https://github.com/hey-shubhamkr/MNIST-Classification/blob/main/MNIST%20using%20Tensorflow.ipynb)
<b>About - Deep Neural Network for MNIST Classification using dataset provided by TensorFlow</b><br>
Here I build a neural network with 2 hidden layers, since this problem is referred to as the "Hello World" of deep learning.
The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition.The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image).
<br><b>The goal </b>is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes.

# [Project 5 : Resalevalue Predictor](https://github.com/hey-shubhamkr/resalevalue-predictor-/blob/master/UsingLinearReg.ipynb)
<b>About - This is a project using Linear regression to predict the price of the used car depending on its specifications </b><br>
Create a best fit line using Scikit-Learn for the given Second Hand Cars data and then predict the resale value.
